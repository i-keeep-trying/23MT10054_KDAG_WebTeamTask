This is a React WebPage(frontend only) created using vite.

Steps to run this:
1. Download the zipped file of the code.
2. Extract them.
3. Right click on the extracted folder and open with VS Code (or any other text editor) (also, you pprobably dont need code editor, opening it in a terminal would also work I guess).
4. In the terminal, cd to the Frontend folder.
5. Then write the code: "npm install".
6. After it downloads, type: "npx vite build".
7. After that simply type "npm run dev", and in the terminal you would be able to see a link like "http://localhost:5173/".
8. Click on the link (or press ctrl + click) to open the website.
